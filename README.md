Algorithm
1.Start
2. Declare a variable to store a number.
3. Ask the user to initialize the number.
4. Check whether it is possible to calculate the factorial or not.
5. If the number is greater than and equal to 0, then call a recursive function to calculate the factorial of the entered number.
6. If the number is lesser than 0, print the message that it is not possible to calculate the factorial.
7. If the entered number is 0 or 1, then return 1.
8. If the entered number is other than 0 or 1, then calculate the factorial by recursively calling the same method.
   Return the result.
9. Print the factorial of the entered number.
10. Stop
