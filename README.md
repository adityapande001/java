Factorial Program in Java: Factorial of n is the product of all positive descending integers. Factorial of n is denoted by n!.
Algorithm
1.Start
2. Declare a variable to store a number.
3. Ask the user to initialize the number.
4. Check whether it is possible to calculate the factorial or not.
5. If the number is greater than and equal to 0, then call a recursive function to calculate the factorial of the entered number.
6. If the number is lesser than 0, print the message that it is not possible to calculate the factorial.
7. If the entered number is 0 or 1, then return 1.
8. If the entered number is other than 0 or 1, then calculate the factorial by recursively calling the same method.
   Return the result.
9. Print the factorial of the entered number.
10. Stop

# Java 2
Suppose we have two operands, a and b, and we have to perform the following arithmetic operations discussed, namely, addition, subtraction, multiply, divide and modulo, hence we assign 5 to a while 3 to b, tracing out for each operation,

Addition can be stated as, a+b which results in 5+3 = 8.

Subtraction can be stated as, a-b which results in 5-3 = 2.

Multiplication can be stated as, ab which results in 53 = 12.

Division can be stated as, a/b which results in 5/3 = 1.

Modulo can be stated as, a%b which results in 5%3 = 2.

As suggested above, any of the operations will be performed, with the result stored in a variable. On printing the result, we end the program successfully.
